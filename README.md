# dotfiles

These are my dotfiles for my Linux machines.

## System

I'm running Arch Linux on a Dell XPS 13 (9360) with HiDPI display and external screen.

## Tools

### [Zsh])(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Z_shell)

Zsh is my favourite shell.

### [Vim])(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vim_(text_editor))

I don't think I have to say much about this. Not to be confused with [the standard editor](https://www.gnu.org/fun/jokes/ed-msg.html)!

### [dwm])(https://dwm.suckless.org/)

dwm is my favourite and also the lightest window manager I have ever used. Practically non-existent. You will not even notice it.

### [st])(https://st.suckless.org/)

st is a simple terminal implementation for X. It always does exactly what it's supposed to do.
